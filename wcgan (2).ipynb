    "Image colorization is the process of adding color to a grayscale image or a black and white image. It involves mapping the intensity values of the grayscale image to a color space, such as RGB, and then filling in the missing color channels to produce a full-color image. There are different ways to approach image colorization, but most methods involve some form of image processing, such as image segmentation, texture synthesis, or machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular approach is to use a deep learning-based method, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to colorize images. This approach typically involves training a CNN on a large dataset of color images, and then using this network to predict the missing color channels of a grayscale image.\n",

    "### 3. Why choosing cGAN over GAN\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) are an extension of standard Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are designed to handle conditional data. A CGAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network, just like a standard GAN. However, in a CGAN, the generator and discriminator are both conditioned on some additional input data. This additional input data can be used to control the output of the generator, allowing it to produce more specific or customized results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why a CGAN can be better than a standard GAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Control over the generated data: In a CGAN, the generator's output is conditioned on the input data, which allows the model to be more specific and controlled in its output. For example, if the input is a grayscale image, the model can colorize it to a specific color scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved stability and training: Because the generator is conditioned on additional input data, it can be easier to train and more stable than a standard GAN. This is because the generator is able to focus on a specific subset of the data, rather than trying to generate all possible outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling missing data: CGANs are well suited for handling missing data or data with missing modalities. The additional input data can be used to condition the generator to produce plausible outputs for the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handling multiple classes: CGANs can be used to generate data for multiple classes in a one-to-many mapping, where the generator is conditioned on the class label and produces an image from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handling conditional data: In some tasks, the data is conditional, such as in image-to-image translation, where the output is conditioned on the input. CGANs can handle this kind of conditional data very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that in some tasks a GAN might be enough or even better than a CGAN, it depends on the task and the data."

    "### Why chosing L*a*b* for our problem ?\n",
    "\n",
    "sing the LAB color space for image colorization can be beneficial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LAB color space is perceptually uniform: The LAB color space separates color information (A and B channels) from lightness information (L channel), which allows for more accurate color representation. This can be particularly useful for image colorization, as it allows for more precise control over the colorization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LAB color space is more suitable for image processing: LAB color space is designed to be perceptually uniform and it separates the lightness information from the color information. This makes it more suitable for image processing tasks such as colorization, where it is important to maintain the relationship between lightness and color.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. LAB color space is more robust to lighting changes: The L channel of the LAB color space represents the lightness of the image, which is relatively robust to changes in lighting conditions. This can be useful when colorizing images taken under different lighting conditions, as it allows for more consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LAB color space is more similar to human vision: The LAB color space is based on the way human eyes perceive color, which means that the results of colorization in LAB space are more similar to what a human would perceive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. LAB color space can be converted to other color spaces: LAB color space can be easily converted to other color spaces such as RGB which is the most common color space used in computer vision and image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To train a model for colorization, we should give it a grayscale image and hope that it will make it colorful. When using L*a*b, we can give the L channel to the model (which is the grayscale image) and want it to¬†predict the other two channels¬†(*a, *b) and after its prediction, we concatenate all the channels and we get our colorful image. But if you use RGB, you have to¬†first convert your image to grayscale, feed the grayscale image to the model and hope¬†it will predict 3 numbers¬†for you which is a way more difficult and unstable task due to the many more possible combinations of 3 numbers compared to two numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that using LAB color space is not the only option for image colorization, and other color spaces such as RGB can also be used. But LAB color space has been proved to be a better option for image colorization due to the above-mentioned reasons."

    "The U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture that is designed for fast and precise segmentation of images. It has performed extremely well in several challenges and to this day, it is one of the most popular end-to-end architectures in the field of semantic segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the network into two parts: \n",
    "* The encoder path (backbone) and the decoder path. The encoder captures features at different scales of the images by using a traditional stack of convolutional and max pooling layers.Concretely speaking, a block in the encoder consists of the repeated use of two convolutional layers (k=3, s=1), each followed by a non-linearity layer, and a max-pooling layer (k=2, s=2). For every convolution block and its associated max pooling operation, the number of feature maps is doubled to ensure that the network can learn the complex structures effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The decoder path is a symmetric expanding counterpart that uses transposed convolutions. This type of convolutional layer is an up-sampling method with trainable parameters and performs the reverse of (down)pooling layers such as the max pool. Similar to the encoder, each convolution block is followed by such an up-convolutional layer. The number of feature maps is halved in every block. Because recreating a segmentation mask from a small feature map is a rather difficult task for the network, the output after every up-convolutional layer is appended by the feature maps of the corresponding encoder block. The feature maps of the encoder layer are cropped if the dimensions exceed the one of the corresponding decoder layers.\n",

Additionally, the Wasserstein distance has a nice property that the gradient of the loss function is always well defined, which allows for more stable optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In WGAN, the critic is trained to approximate the Wasserstein distance between the real and fake data distributions. The generator is trained to generate samples that will cause the critic to output low values. In WGAN, the critic network is trained to be a 1-Lipschitz function, which means that the critic's output should change by at most 1 for any small change in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, WGAN is a more stable and well-defined version of GAN, that allows for more control over the training process and can help to improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples."

    "### 1. Human scoring\n",
    "One way to evaluate the performance of a GAN is to use human scoring, where real images and images created by the GAN are randomly stacked together, and human scorers label each image as real or fake. This can be done using platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inception Score (IS)\n",
    "Another way to evaluate GAN performance is to use the Inception Score, which uses a pre-trained Inception model to classify the generated images. The IS considers both the quality and diversity of the generated images by measuring the entropy of the classification labels. The higher the entropy, the more diverse and unpredictable the generated images are, indicating a better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img width = \"700px\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RdIYRsqXxRAKwcjtxg6_kw.jpeg\"></center>\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Frechet Inception Distance (FID)\n",
    "In Frechet Inception Distance (FID), we utilize the Inception network to extract features from an intermediate layer. Then, we model the data distribution for these features using a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and covariance $\\Sigma$. The FID between the real images $x$ and generated images $g$ is computed as: \\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$FID(x,g) = \\left\\|\\mu_x - \\mu_g\\right\\|^2_2 + Tr(\\Sigma_x + \\Sigma_g - 2(\\Sigma_x\\Sigma_g)^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Tr$ sums up all the diagonal elements. Lower FID values indicate better image quality and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "FID is sensitive to mode collapse, meaning that as the distance between simulated missing modes increases, the FID value will also increase. Additionally, FID is more robust to noise than Inception Score (IS) as it is less affected by models that only generate one image per class. Therefore, FID is a better measurement for image diversity. However, it should be noted that FID has some rather high bias but low variance. By computing the FID between a training dataset and a testing dataset, we should expect the FID to be zero since both are real images. However, running the test with different batches of training sample shows non-zero FID.\n"

    "    üìò In conclusion, Pix2pix is a powerful model for image-to-image translation tasks, but it can be further improved for specific applications such as colorization. Using Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and a U-Net architecture based on residual blocks are two ways to improve the performance of pix2pix for colorization. WGANs use the Wasserstein distance metric to train the generator and discriminator which can help stabilize the training process and produce more realistic results. A U-Net architecture which is well-suited for image segmentation tasks combined with Residual blocks allows the network to learn fine details of the input image, which can be particularly useful for colorization tasks. This can help improve the stability and the ability to learn fine details of the input image, producing more realistic results.\n",
